# Self-Driving Car

A simple Self-Driving Car

- Highly recommend to use IDE (My choice: <b>Spyder</b> 3.1.4)
- By the way, <b>Anaconda</b> already contains Spyder.

The implementation of Double DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay (Proportional Prioritization) is based on van Hasselt et al. [Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf) [2015.12] and Schaul et al. [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf) [2016.02].

## Environment
- <b>Python</b> 2.7.13
- <b>NumPy</b> 1.13.1
- <b>Kivy</b> 1.10.0
- (Optional) <b>PyTorch</b> 0.2.0_1
- (Optional) <b>Theano</b> 0.9.0
- (Optional) <b>TensorFlow</b> 1.0.0 or 1.1.* or 1.2.*

<b>NOTE</b>: Among PyTorch, Theano and TensorFlow, we only need to choose one of them.
