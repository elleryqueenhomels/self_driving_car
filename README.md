# Self-Driving Car

A simple Self-Driving Car

- Highly recommend to use IDE (My choice: Spyder 3.1.4)
- By the way, Anaconda already contains Spyder.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.13
- NumPy 1.13.1
- Kivy 1.10.0
- (Optional) PyTorch 0.2.0_1
- (Optional) Theano 0.9.0
- (Optional) TensorFlow 1.0.0 or 1.1.* or 1.2.*

<b>NOTE</b>: Among PyTorch, Theano and TensorFlow, we only need to choose one of them.
